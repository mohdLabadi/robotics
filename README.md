In hw3:


In hw4: In this homework, you will implement both A* and RRT planning algorithms for the MuSHR car and the Widowx250 arm robot. While this sounds intimidating, you will soon realize that planning algorithms can be easily generalized to different platforms.


In hw5: In this homework, you will implement several fundamental path tracking control algorithms: PID and MPC1. To accurately track the desired paths, you will tune the parameters that govern their behavior. As a result, you will also become familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the various feedback control strategies discussed in this course.
