In hw3:In this project, you will implement the particle filter algorithm for MuSHR car and Widowx250 arm robot.
Object tracking refers to locating moving objects over time upon initial detection of the object. One of the main advantages of using tracking algorithms is robustness to noise and occlusions during object detection. For a variety of tasks involving robot arms, like visual servoing and in-hand manipulation, it is crucial to accurately detect and track the target object. Visual servoing involves controlling a robot arm using feedback from vision-based sensors. We have designed a toy visual servoing experiment with the arm end-effector following a cylinder moving around it. In the experiment setup, we use RGB image obtained from a camera placed above the robot arm capturing the top down view. In this section, you will track the moving cylinder by implementing the particle filter algorithm.


In hw4: In this homework, you will implement both A* and RRT planning algorithms for the MuSHR car and the Widowx250 arm robot. While this sounds intimidating, you will soon realize that planning algorithms can be easily generalized to different platforms.


In hw5: In this homework, you will implement several fundamental path tracking control algorithms: PID and MPC1. To accurately track the desired paths, you will tune the parameters that govern their behavior. As a result, you will also become familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the various feedback control strategies discussed in this course.
