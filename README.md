In hw5: In this homework, you will implement several fundamental path tracking control algorithms: PID and MPC1. To accurately track the desired paths, you will tune the parameters that govern their behavior. As a result, you will also become familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the various feedback control strategies discussed in this course.
